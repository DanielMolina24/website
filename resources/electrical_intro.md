###Base Kit <a name="BaseKit"></a>
Our base kit provides the minimal required electrical components to build a minimally driving robot. It includes:

* [Battery](https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/battery-charging-guideline/266) 
A Lithium-Polymer battery that has a voltage of ~11.2 Volts during regular use. These kinds of batteries are powerful but can be rather dangerous if charged incorrectly.

* [Power Distribution Board](https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/power-distribution-board-pdb/272) 
Distributes power from Battery to rest of robot

 * Circuit Breaker(https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/power-distribution-board-pdb/272#circuitbreaker)
Universal On/Off switch for robot

 * [Battery Buzzer](https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/power-distribution-board-pdb/272#buzzer)
Notifies user when battery level is too low

* Beaglebone Black (BBB)
Brain of the Robot; an on board computer

* [Motor Controller](https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/motor-controller-yogi-bear/276)
Controls the motors on the robot

* [Team Flag](https://forum.pierobotics.org/t/team-flag/290)
