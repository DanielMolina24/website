Are you interested in developing your skills in building and designing?

Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) is launching a new series of monthly workshops for local high school students in September, October and November.


## Creating Code with PiE
This month, PiE will be hosting its second workshop at UC Berkeley on Saturday, September 29th from 10 AM to 3:00 PM in Soda Hall. While our workshop is intended for students with no programming experience, students from all backgrounds and experiences are appreciated and very welcome! At this workshop, students will learn about basic programming logic, variables, conditionals and loops, functions, and get a taste of recursion -- all in Scratch! We hope to see you all there. Computers will be provided so you will not need to bring your own!

If you have any questions, please email <mailto:education@pioneers.berkeley.edu>.

## Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering

The first in our series of Fall Workshops, Building Bridges with Pioneers in Engineering took place on campus on Saturday, September 24th from 9:45 AM to 3:00 PM in O'Brien Breezeway. Students from all backgrounds and experiences had tool training, learned about prototyping, design, and participated in designing and constructing their own bridge.
