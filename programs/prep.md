# PREP

PREP is PiEâ€™s Fall mentorship program. It spans from September through the first four weeks of the Spring semester, just prior to competition season. This program aims to spark underserved high school students' interest in STEM and to provide them with mentors to nurture this interest further. We achieve this ambitious goal with cool projects like hovercrafts, marshmallow trebuchets, and robotic arms.

In addition to this gentle introduction to STEM, PREP also tries to inspire the students to pursue higher education. We organize a student field trip to the UC Berkeley campus and host Q&A sessions with current undergraduates.

This year, the participating schools in the PiE PREP Program are Ralph Bunche High School, Middle College High School, and Community Day School in Oakland. PREP piloted at Ralph Bunche two years ago with much success, and since then we have grown a lot. We now have more students, projects, and ideas than ever before.

If you are interested in being a mentor for PiE PREP, look [here]({{site.baseurl}}/get-involved/become-mentor.html) to see how! Check back here later this year to access our lesson plans.
