# What is Dawn?
Dawn is the software through which students can upload code to their robot and receive information. It is essentially a multi-featured app interface through which you can interact with the robot (which runs using Runtime). Dawn runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux distributions.

## Editor
Dawn provides an editor interface, which occupies the left side of the app. Code written here can be uploaded to the robot. In addition, users can save their files, re-open them, and start new files using the File menu options, menu buttons, or the shortcuts. 
### Menu Buttons
The Robot buttons include “Upload”, “Run”, and “Stop”. All three buttons can only be used when the robot is connected. If the robot is not running, the stop button will be disabled.
The Console buttons “Console” and “Clear” serve to toggle the console element at the bottom of the editor and to clear the console output, respectively.
The Misc buttons include “Show API”, “Increase font size”, “Decrease font size”, “Updates”, “Configuration”. “Show API”. “Show API” opens a new window with the Robot code API, and the font size buttons configure the size of the font in the text editor. “Updates” allows students to upload updates to Runtime when students are given updates. “Configuration” allows students to configure the IP Address through which to connect to the robot.
### Console
A console is, generally put, a debugging interface that prints out messages from code or a receiver. The console in Dawn is responsible for displaying messages that Dawn receives from the robot (Runtime), which is essentially the output that can be expected from a running Python interpreter: print results, Python error messages, etc. Keep in mind that the robot must be connected for Dawn to receive any information to display on the console.
## Peripherals
Peripherals, located on the upper right corner, displays live sensor values collected from each sensor of a connected Robot.
