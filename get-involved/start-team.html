    <h1> Start a Team</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the team application for the PiE 2016 Robotics Competition!</p>

    <h2> How to Start a Team</h2>
    <p><b>1. Form a team.</b> We recommend teams of around 12 students, although we have teams ranging from 4-20.</p>
    <p><b>2. Find a teacher.</b> Your math/science/computer science teacher may be willing to sponsor your team. They can be as involved in the process(or not) as they/you want, but a teacher must be registered as a sponsor. </p>
    <p><b>3. Fill out our Team Application(released Nov. 2nd)</b> The application is available above. Please fill it out by the end of <b>November</b>.</p>
    <p><b>4. Cross your fingers and wait for a response!</b> Because there is a very large interest in PiE, we unfortunately cannot support every team that applies. Selection is based largely on accessibility(we need to be able to send mentors to your school every week) and the passion of your team as demonstrated in the application. Good luck! </p>

    <h2> Team Requirements</h2>
      <p>Successful teams should fulfill these basic requirements.</p>
  
    <p><li><b>Your team must be able to meet multiple times per week, and at least two hours a week with your mentor.</b>Building robots is no walk in the park, and it takes much longer than you think to get things working! Our most successful teams often meet 15 hours or more per week.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Your team must attend Kickoff, Game Day, Design Reviews, Scrimmage, and Final Competition.</b>Dates for these events are listed below.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>You must send weekly updates on your progress.</b> It is important for us to know how you're doing. Plus, good engineers always document their work.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>You must have access to a computer with internet. </b> We send out weekly updates with important information over email. You will also need a computer to be able to program your robot.</li></p>
