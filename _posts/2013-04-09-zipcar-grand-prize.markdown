Today, PiE was announced the winner of Zipcar's Students-With-Drive competition! We would like to thank everybody who took the time to vote for us, and those who continue to support us and our endeavors. We ran against four deserving contenders with great missions, and won by a margin of just about 50 votes - out of a total of over 10,000\. In this close of a competition, each and every single one of your votes counted. 

Please visit our website for updates and continue to follow PiE's adventures! We will now move onto the second half of our 2013 PiE Robotics season, with our Final Competition on April 27 and 28, at the Lawrence Hall of Science.
