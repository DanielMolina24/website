"Judging this year is the hardest I've ever seen it," Brian Harvey tells the crowd anticipating the Judges' Awards this year. This says a lot, as he's been a judge for PiE for four years. "It is a&nbsp;<em>pleasant</em>&nbsp;thing that it's is so hard to choose recipients," he says, implying that this is an indication of the outstanding designs this year.&nbsp;</p>
