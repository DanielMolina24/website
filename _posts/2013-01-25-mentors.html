<p>Think back to your time in high school:&nbsp;&nbsp;questions about college, uncertainties about your future, and what seemed like an endless pile of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;When thoughts of college became overwhelming, we looked to our role models for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is where PiE and, more importantly, mentors as individuals come into play.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mentor, you will find students from a particular school and stay with them throughout the entire eight week PiE competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The students will grow and change under your guidance, and you will become the person they go to when they need help or have questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In addition, you&rsquo;ll be able to stimulate your creativity as you assist the students in building and designing a fully operational robot.&nbsp;Uncertain of your technical skills?&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem!&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentors may enroll in a student run, UC Berkeley course that will teach prospective mentors anything that they may need to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Already a robotics veteran? We will also be hosting and advanced course that takes on more difficult topics such as autonomous programming and sensor control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we mention that you could get class credit too?</p>
<p>If you are interested in signing up, look under the &ldquo;Get Involved-Become a Mentor&rdquo; tab at the top of this page.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any specific questions or concerns, e-mail us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mentorship@pioneers.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">mentorship@pioneers.berkeley.edu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept all ages and all majors, and you need not be a UC Berkeley student to apply.</p>
