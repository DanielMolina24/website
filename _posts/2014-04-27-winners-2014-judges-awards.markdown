Awards are given yearly at the end of Final Competition to recognize team accomplishments. "Judging this year is the hardest I've ever seen it," Brian Harvey tells the crowd anticipating the Judges' Awards this year. This says a lot, as he's been a judge for PiE for four years. "It is a _pleasant_ thing that it's is so hard to choose recipients," he says, implying that this is an indication of the outstanding designs this year. 

In fact, judging was so difficult that the judges found it necessary to do shout-outs to schools they felt exhibited excellence in each category, since there could only be one winner chosen. The list of recipients for the awards are listed below.
