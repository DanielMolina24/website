<p dir="ltr"><span>PiE Robotics Competition Kickoff is always an exciting event, and this year was no exception. &nbsp;Teams met their mentors, received their Robotics Kits, and many were able to finish the day having achieved their goal of constructing a driving base robot!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>However, just three weeks before, the 2014 Robotics Competition was in danger of cancellation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">It was then when we learned that the <a href="https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/256">Fez Panda II</a>, an irreplaceable component of our Robotics Kit, was being retired by all suppliers. &nbsp;Sparkfun Electronics, a longtime supporter of PiE without whom our competition could not have happened this year, was unable to supply all the Panda II&rsquo;s we require.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This revelation set off a quite a stir among us, who immediately took the &lsquo;Pandamonium&rsquo; in hand and started searching for solutions. &nbsp;We quickly discovered that the surest way to save the competition was to manufacture our own pandas - no mean feat, considering that we had 3 weeks to do what should take 3 months.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The manufacture of pandas would not have been possible without the support of one company in particular, <a href="https://www.ghielectronics.com">GHI Electronics</a>. &nbsp;PIE&rsquo;s use of the Panda II requires a specific firmware to be loaded onto a key component of the Pandas. &nbsp;GHI, the sole supplier of this software, graciously offered to load this firmware onto the chips at reduced cost, even though PiE needed a comparatively small quantity, and even though both the chips and the software are outdated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are incredibly grateful to GHI and in particular Gary Beaver, their Director of Operations, for their fast response and generosity.</span></p>
<p>Without their help, Pandas would have gone extinct, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a Robotics Competition this year<strong id="docs-internal-guid-cf74acd8-dbd9-89ff-5a9e-c4f1c13ba2ec"><span>.</span></strong></p>
