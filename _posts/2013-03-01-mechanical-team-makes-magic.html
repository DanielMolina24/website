<p>Where do dreams of the 2,299 parts of PiE&rsquo;s robotic kit go to materialize? It all happens in a mechanical machine shop in the basement of Etcheverry Hall. Since November of last year, PiE&rsquo;s mechanical team has spent about 1-2 days a week, 3-4 hours a day in the machine shop. Manufacturing is a lengthy process, so mechanical designs, drawings, deadlines, and plans were all frozen as early as last October. The machine shop is a resource provided by UC Berkeley's Mechanical Engineering Department.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We are proud of the fact that we are able to take a resource that the university provides us and do the biggest production they&rsquo;ve ever seen there. We&rsquo;ve done on a per part basis this year more machining than any other mechanical engineering student group has ever done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The base kit modules and its extensions that goes out to the high school teams have been completely redesigned to&nbsp;to reduce the barriers of entry to more creative design for students. The new kit is able to be assembled multiple different ways straight out of the box; this way, students can finish building the driving base sooner, allowing room and time for creative designs. There is a tremendous amount of functionality just waiting for students to pick and choose, and glue it together.&nbsp;</p>
