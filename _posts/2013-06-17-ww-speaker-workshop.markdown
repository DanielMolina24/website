It's always a great opportunity for PiE to get involved with our local community and share what excites us. We're happy to announce that we will be hosting a workshop at [Workshop Weekend][0], a community based event, this coming _Saturday, June 22\. This workshop will start at 10 A.M and is located at [Tech Liminal][1]: 555 12th St. \#110 in Oakland._

In the past, we found that regardless of age or background of participants, our workshops piqued an interest in science and engineering. This year, we will be hosting a free workshop where participants will be able to learn about electricity and batteries through creating speakers from styrofoam bowls, neodymium magnets, and other materials.

For an exclusive discount code to the event and a list of workshops being held throughout the weekend, [please visit this link][2]. Join us for a day of fun with science! We hope to see you there.
