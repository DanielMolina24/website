<p dir="ltr"><span>PiE has grown in various ways over the last six years. We have expanded our season by a week, doubled the length of our Final Competition, nearly tripled our staff roster, and extended our reach into San Francisco. Another important sign of our growth is the increasing number of PiE alumni now in academia and industry.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Last October, Vanathi Ganesh (Class of &lsquo;13 EECS), a former PiE DeCal instructor, conceived the idea of reaching out to Tau Beta Pi and PiE staff alumni to create an annual scholarship for PiE students moving on to post-secondary education. The idea has come to fruition: this spring, one $1000 scholarship will be awarded. The application went live this past Saturday at Game Day and will be due on April 14, the Monday after Scrimmage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We&rsquo;re very excited to offer this opportunity for the first time! Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the philanthropic support of our TBP and PiE alumni. We are deeply grateful for the financial and technical support that they have provided to PiE in order to explore a new avenue of supporting STEM education in the Bay Area.</span></p>
