<p dir="ltr"><span>This last Sunday, October 20, PiE was present at the Annual East Bay Mini Maker Faire, which took place in Oakland, California. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mini Maker Faire is the smaller scale, more kid-accessible version of its parent Bay Area Maker Faire. &nbsp;There were a variety of makers present showing off their work, from blacksmiths to tech-savvy app developers. &nbsp;In addition to the displays, there were a lot of hands-on activities for visitors, including launching hand-made paper rockets in the sky and building creative Lego designs on the Lego Jeep. &nbsp;PiE had taken two robots, and had given visitors the opportunity drive one of the robots. &nbsp;</span></p>
