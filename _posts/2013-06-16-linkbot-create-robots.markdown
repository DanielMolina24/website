Meet the Linkbot. It's a modular robotic that can be engaged by beginners and advanced makers alike. The Linkbot boasts unique, flexible built-in modes (TiltDrive, CopyCat, PoseTeaching, BumpConnect) that allow users to creatively customize each robot.

Brian Orr, a former PiE 2010 alumnus, has helped make Linkbot. He describes  his experience in Pioneers in Engineering as "life-changing" and "fantastic," and wants others to experience the same.
