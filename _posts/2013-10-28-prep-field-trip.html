<p dir="ltr"><span>On Friday October 25 the tables were reversed, and Prep students came to the UC Berkeley campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a part of the college preparation unit, Prep students were brought to the UC Berkeley campus to get a taste of college life. &nbsp;The students spent the day touring the campus with the mentors, getting to see some of the school&rsquo;s highlights: the T-Rex in VLSB, Upper Sproul plaza, Doe Library, among others. &nbsp;For many, it was their first trip up the Campanile. &nbsp;As a part of the tour, students got a taste of life on the engineering side of campus. &nbsp;They got to see the engineering work areas, such as the Hackerspace in Cory or the Civil Engineering work area in Davis; students also got to see some of the projects undergraduate engineers work on, such as the concrete canoe.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the campus tour, the students had a guest lecture by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prometheusuntenured/">Terry Johnson</a>, from the Bioengineering Department at UC Berkeley. &nbsp;Johnson&rsquo;s talk highlighted what it meant to be someone in science or in engineering. &nbsp;He challenged the long-standing image of scientists and engineers as math geniuses with access to high-tech labs, stating that all it takes is curiosity and the drive to find solutions to problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid--d0d2899-0270-9428-0a41-f800caf37dac"><span>And with this Prep students continue into the rest of the Prep season, an uncharted domain for their curiosity. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
