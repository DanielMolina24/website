<p dir="ltr"><span>We have extended the deadline for the </span><a href="/programs/scholarship/"><span>inaugural PiE Alumni Scholarship</span></a><span> to </span><span>5p PST on Friday, April 18. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We have made the </span><span>transcript and teacher recommendation optional, but recommended,</span><span> in light of time concerns. If you have already turned in a transcript or a teacher recommendation, we will take them into consideration during the review process. We anticipate that this will strengthen your application.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It&rsquo;s not too late to start the application! We strongly encourage every senior to apply since we are drawing from a limited pool of applicants. All those that apply have very good odds of receiving the scholarship.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please let us know if you encounter difficulties of any kind by emailing </span><span>scholarship@pioneers.berkeley.edu.&nbsp;</span>We hope to see your application!</p>
