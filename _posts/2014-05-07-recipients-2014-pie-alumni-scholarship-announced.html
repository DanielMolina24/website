<p dir="ltr">After receiving many high quality applications from determined seniors pursuing higher education, the PiE scholarship committee - consisting of PiE staff alumni - faced the tough decision of choosing an applicant to receive the $1000 scholarship.</p>
<p>The committee reviewed each application holistically, considering academic achievement, leadership skills, and extracurricular activities. After much deliberation, the committee selected four finalists from an incredibly strong field of candidates to receive $100 each, as well as the scholarship recipient. Vanathi Ganesh (EECS &lsquo;13), a PiE alumna and a member of the scholarship committee, announced the finalists and scholarship award winner at the award ceremony after final competition.</p>
