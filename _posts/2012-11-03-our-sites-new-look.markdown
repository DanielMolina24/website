Hi everyone! You may have noticed that our website has a fresh new look. We redesigned the front end of our site from the ground up, featuring a much prettier and modern template and a more intuitive navigation tree. We hope this makes your browsing experience more pleasant and informative.

We are hard at work adding more features and functionality to our site to get it ready for the PiE 2013 season. Please feel free to email [pit@pioneers.berkeley.edu][0] if you have any questions or suggestions about our site!

-Amy Fu, former Director and current IT member
