<p>On July 19<sup>th</sup>, with the help of Bay Area Teen Science (B.A.T.S.), Science@Cal, and First Graduate, PiE was able to showcase its robots to hundreds of middle and high school students at the Bay School of San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had the chance to talk to several students about what life is like in college.&nbsp; What can I do as an engineer?&nbsp; Which classes should I take?&nbsp; Is college a lot harder than high school?&nbsp; These were just a few of the questions students asked as they visited our table in the courtyard.&nbsp; The students were quite interested to hear from Berkeley students, and many of them will soon begin the process of choosing their own colleges and careers.&nbsp; It was great to see that so many students were interested in careers in STEM.</p>
<p>At our table, students were able to learn about current, voltage, and power by experimenting with different circuits built from components of Snap Circuits kits.&nbsp; Many students practiced their driving skills by maneuvering a robot around a circular course and pushing blocks around.&nbsp; Finally, we were able to watch chemical reactions take place as we mixed Diet Coke and Mentos together for a very spectacular result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were many great booths at the event, and it was a pleasure to be around so many individuals who love STEM education.&nbsp; Thanks again to the coordinators of the event, Dan and Ann; PiE had a great time working with everyone!</p>
