<p>Halloween: tricks, treats, and...flying pumpkins? This year, the PiE team built a giant trebuchet for Lawrence Hall of Science's Creepy Happy Halloween&nbsp;event. The finished model had a&nbsp;<em>sixteen foot tall</em> arm to launch 10 lb. pumpkins 200 feet across the lawn!</p>
<p>But it turns out that we're not the only creative ones: participants showed off their skills in PiE's supplementary workshop "Build Your Own Catapult," where they were able to build their mini catapult using legos, spoons, and rubber bands! Participants were also able to try out PiE's autofiring robot - and try to launch raquetballs into a castle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bay Area News Group&nbsp;captured the launch and the happy kids. <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid16752273001?bckey=AQ~~%2CAAAAAGAiBRQ~%2CBjKnLqnuNvrujdfSBytcFRaZpIIfGYyw&amp;bclid=1620732838&amp;bctid=1928869440001">Check it out!</a></p>
