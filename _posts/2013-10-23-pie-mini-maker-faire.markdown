This last Sunday, October 20, PiE was present at the Annual East Bay Mini Maker Faire, which took place in Oakland, California.  

Mini Maker Faire is the smaller scale, more kid-accessible version of its parent Bay Area Maker Faire.  There were a variety of makers present showing off their work, from blacksmiths to tech-savvy app developers.  In addition to the displays, there were a lot of hands-on activities for visitors, including launching hand-made paper rockets in the sky and building creative Lego designs on the Lego Jeep.  PiE had taken two robots, and had given visitors the opportunity drive one of the robots.  

PiE will be out in the public again this Saturday October 26 at Lawrence Hall of Science's [Robots vs. Insects event][0].  PiE has prepared a few activities, including an interactive lesson on firefly communication.  We hope to see you there!
