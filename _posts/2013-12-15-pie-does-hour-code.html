<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1d47f39f-fa5f-04e0-7f57-22ad18fab02c">After <a href="/blog/2013/12/11/hour-code/">volunteering at Joaquin Miller Elementary School</a> this past Wednesday, PiE had a day full of Hour of Code in honor of CS Education Week.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Early in the morning on Friday, PiE members visited Oakland Technical High School to participate in their CS ED Week assembly. &nbsp;As a part of the assembly, there were representatives from the Oakland School District, Level Playing Field, UC Berkeley, Computer Science Teachers&rsquo; Assosiation, as well as Ali Partovi, co-founder of code.org and one of the primary organizers of the Hour of Code. &nbsp;Partovi made a brief presentation, during which he spoke about his experiences with CS, starting from seventh grade, and about the importance of computer science in society, as well as CS Education Week. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Following the assembly at Oakland Technical High School, PiE hosted an Hour of Code at Ralph Bunche High School and Alameda Community Learning Center, as a part of the PiE Prep program. &nbsp;Students spent an entire hour doing an online tutorial, which varied from the Blockly Angry Birds tutorial to any of the Javascript tutorials.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">PiE was glad to be a part of CS Education Week and to have hosted an Hour of Code. &nbsp;For those of you interested in doing a tutorial at home, check out <a href="http://code.org/learn">code.org</a>.</p>
