As the [tiny student-made lego robots][0] competed in a miniature scale tug-of-war game, the fifth week of Prep lessons came to a close.

[PiE Prep][1] is our weekly intensive mentorship program that runs from the start of Berkeley's Fall semester to the start of the PiE Robotics Competition in the Spring.  We work to develop innovative STEM-focused curriculum in which students have the opportunity to work on hands-on projects that they would not be exposed to in a traditional classroom setting.  This year we've returned to Ralph Bunche High School in Oakland for a second year and are piloting a new curriculum at Alameda Community Learning Center in Alameda. (Check out [this blog post][2] from last year about Prep.)

During this fifth week of lessons (out of thirteen), Prep mentors concluded a three week mechanical design unit with ACLC students, by pitting student-made robots against each other in a game of tug-of-war.  Meanwhile, at Ralph Bunche, Prep mentors presented about college, giving students an opportunity to ask questions about financial aid and the application process.  The presentation also served as preparation for the students' field trip to the UC Berkeley campus next week.  

Stay tuned to follow Prep's progress throughout the season!
