The body of the blog goes here. Everything above the dashes will not be in the post text.

This example post contains information on how to write posts. To learn how to get the posts on the website, see the [wiki](https://github.com/pioneers/website/wiki/Writing-Blog-Posts).

To customize the accompanying image, place the image in assets/images/blog/. You can see the other posts for examples.

Note that the name of this file doesn't match include a date. This prevents this article from appearing on the website. To have your post appear on the website, the format needs to emulate: 2015-03-31-annual-report.markdown

If you're interested in fancier formatting, Jekyll utilizes markdown. [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) does a great job of explaining how to use markdown in depth, but you might be most interested in the following features of markdown.

Hyperlinks use this syntax: [Link text](http://actual-link.com)

Ordered Lists

1. Ordered lists just require numbers in front
8. They don't actually require the numbers to be in order

Unordered Lists

- Bulleted lists are also simple
- They just require dashes

[This site](http://tmpvar.com/markdown.html) will show you what the article will look like on the website with markdown. If you're using a lot of markdown features, writing the article within this site will make troubleshooting much faster. Specifically, jekyll utiizes kramdown which you can learn more about [here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). Alternatively, .markdown files can also be read as .html files, so one could write in html as well.
