PiE 2014 final scholarship recipient Alix receiving her award after final competition 

After the successful debut of the PiE Alumni Scholarship last year, PiE alumni have been working to plan another scholarship this year! Thanks to the generosity of PiE alumni, this scholarship has been increased from $1000 to $1500 this year.

Alix Plascensia, who is PiE scholarship's previous winner and a current freshman at UC Berkeley, states that the PiE Alumni Scholarship has helped a lot in terms of her education. Because of the scholarship, she could take some time off from her job and pursue her education by joining Summer Bridge, a six-week college program that offers newly admitted freshmen to jump start their academic career. She wrote to PiE Alumni Scholarship committee about how she is enjoying her study, and we are glad to know it. Her positive feedback shows how a little help can have a huge impact in student's life.

This year, we hope that all eligible students take advantage of this opportunity. High school students who are in their last year of education, have participated in a PiE season, and plan to pursue higher level of education are eligible and highly encouraged to apply for this scholarship. The applicants will be holistically assessed, but we are generally looking for applicants who have some STEM experiences. The application will be released on **February 28, 2015** during Kickoff. On the same day at **2pm**, there will be a scholarship workshop at **120B Becthel** **380 Soda** where students can get their questions answered and guidance to fill out the scholarship application.

For the application to be considered, applicants should submit their **scholarship application and a copy of their unofficial transcript** by **April 11, 2015**. Though recommendation is optional, applicants are highly recommended to submit a 2-page recommendation form since the recommendation will definitely strengthen the application.The scholarship recipient will be announced around late April and early May. We highly encourage that PiE students take advantage of and spread the word about this opportunity!For more detailed information, check out [PiE scholarship webpage][0]. Or you can email any questions to scholarship@pioneers.berkeley.edu.  

If you would also like to support the PiE Alumni Scholarship, please consider making a donation! Any contribution is welcome. Donations can be made to Fund Number 3231 on the [Give to Cal website][1]. At the bottom of the form, please write "Scholarship" in the field titled "Special instructions or designations for this gift."

EDIT (2/28/15 @ 12:15AM: Workshop location has been changed to **380 Soda**.
