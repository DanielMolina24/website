<div>Last Saturday, June 22, PiE hosted a&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;at Tech Liminal as a part of <a title="Workshop Weekend" href="/pit-admin/zinnia/entry/30/workshopweekend.net" target="_blank"><span class="il">Workshop</span>&nbsp;</a><span class="il"><a href="/pit-admin/zinnia/entry/30/workshopweekend.net" target="_blank">Weekend</a>, a two-day event for community learning</span>. Participants of the&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;made speakers from styrofoam bowls, neodymium magnets, coiled copper wires, and other everyday materials.</div>
<div>PiE's&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;had six participants of all ages. The&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;began with a&nbsp;brief introduction to&nbsp;the electromagnetic elements involved in sound production, followed by each student assembling his or her own speaker. As the speakers started coming together, students began experimenting with their designs. One eager learner piled on extra magnets to improve the volume of his speaker, while another tweaked a coil to improve the responsiveness of her own. Throughout the workshop, the students&nbsp;slowly began to appreciate how the materials' various configurations&nbsp;influenced the speaker's performance.</div>
<div>Everyone&nbsp;left the&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;satisfied with their work and with a working&nbsp;speaker&nbsp;as a souvenir. One of the participants commented that PiE's&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>&nbsp;was the best she had ever&nbsp;participated in because every participant had a functioning product by the end of the&nbsp;<span class="il">workshop</span>. &nbsp;</div>
<div>We'd like to give a warm thank you to our participants and to the organizers of&nbsp;<span class="il">Workshop</span>&nbsp;<span class="il">Weekend</span>, Gil and J.D. Zamfirescu, for making hands-on education in the community more accessible&nbsp;to all. &nbsp;</div>
