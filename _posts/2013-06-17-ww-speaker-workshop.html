This workshop will start at 10 A.</span></span>M and is located at <a href="http://techliminal.com/">Tech Liminal</a>: 555 12th St. #110 in Oakland.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span> In the past, we </span>found that regardless of age or background of participants, our workshops piqued an interest in science and engineering. This year, we will be hosting a free workshop where participants will be able to learn about electricity and batteries through creating speakers from styrofoam bowls, neodymium magnets, and other materials.</p>
