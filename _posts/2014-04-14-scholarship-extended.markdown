We have extended the deadline for the [inaugural PiE Alumni Scholarship][0] to 5p PST on Friday, April 18\. 

We have made the transcript and teacher recommendation optional, but recommended, in light of time concerns. If you have already turned in a transcript or a teacher recommendation, we will take them into consideration during the review process. We anticipate that this will strengthen your application.

It's not too late to start the application! We strongly encourage every senior to apply since we are drawing from a limited pool of applicants. All those that apply have very good odds of receiving the scholarship.

Please let us know if you encounter difficulties of any kind by emailing scholarship@pioneers.berkeley.edu. We hope to see your application!
