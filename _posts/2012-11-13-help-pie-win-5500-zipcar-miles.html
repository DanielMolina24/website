<p>We have some exciting news: Pioneers in Engineering is a finalist in the Zipcar Students with Drive contest! This means that we could win $5,500 in Zipcar hours if we win a Facebook voting competition. <br /> <br />With that many Zipcar hours, we can let our wonderful mentors use Zipcar to get from Berkeley to our high schools easier during the competition season. That means mentors will be able to spend less time commuting, and more time helping students build their robots!<br /> <br /><strong>Please vote for us and help us win this contest!</strong> It only takes 2 minutes at this link: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/students-with-drive/" target="_blank">http://apps.facebook.com/students-with-drive/</a><br /> <br />You will have to add the app, like Zipcar, and then you will be able to vote for PiE in the Academic category! Then, share it with your friends and ask them to vote for us too!<br /><br />Every vote counts!</p>
